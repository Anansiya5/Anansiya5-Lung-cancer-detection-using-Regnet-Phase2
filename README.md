**ADVANCING LUNG CANCER DETECTION: A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THROUGH REGULARIZED NETWORKS (REGNET) FOR IMPROVED ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY**

## About
Lung cancer stands as a significant contributor to cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection via screening holds promise for better outcomes, yet manual analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans is labor-intensive and prone to human error. Recent advancements in deep learning offer potential for automating lung cancer screening. This study delves into utilizing a Regularized Network (RegNet) model for classifying benign and malignant lung nodules in CT scans. RegNet employs optimizations like model depth, width, and input resolution to balance performance and accuracy effectively. Despite fewer parameters compared to similar models, RegNet achieves notable accuracy due to its regularization techniques. The RegNet family of convolutional neural network architectures adopts a simple yet highly regularized design pattern. Training the network involves annotated nodule CT scans, with additional measures taken to prevent overfitting. In testing, RegNet demonstrates accuracy comparable to or exceeding that of radiologists, particularly at low false positive rates, showcasing its proficiency in distinguishing between benign and malignant nodules.

## Results and Impact
Detecting lung cancer through the application of RegNet, a special-ized neural network tailored for image recognition, presents a promis-ing frontier in medical diagnostics. RegNet's adeptness in deep learn-ing enables the precise analysis and interpretation of medical images, particularly CT scans, with notable accuracy. This proficiency aids in the early and precise identification of lung cancer. Leveraging ma-chine learning capabilities, RegNet has the potential to discern intri-cate patterns and anomalies within lung images that might evade hu-man observation. Moreover, the utilization of RegNet holds promise in minimizing false positives and negatives, thereby reducing unnec-essary interventions and ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential cases. However, despite its potential, integrating RegNet into clinical settings demands rigorous validation, continuous refinement, and seamless integration into existing healthcare frameworks. Collabora-tive efforts between medical professionals, data scientists, and regula-tory bodies are imperative to address ethical considerations, uphold data privacy, and guarantee the technology's reliability. In conclusion, deploying RegNet for lung cancer detection represents a substantial leap in medical imaging. Its precision, rapidity, and capacity to trans-form diagnostic procedures present a hopeful prospect for early detec-tion and improved treatment strategies in combating this debilitating disease. Ongoing research and development endeavors in this domain hold promise for advancing healthcare practices, ultimately enhancing patient care.
